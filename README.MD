# SequencerTremolo

# Project Overview:
An n-step sequencer similar to that found on many synthesizers. It provides user inputs to enable/disable pulses in n steps, as well as the length of time for each step. Once the control loop processes all the steps it returns to the beginning and repeats. This project also provides a tap tempo input.
